## Introduction: Background


**Background**

- Hypertension is a leading risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, affecting public health worldwide and prominently in the U.S. 

**Problem**

- Following an initial improvement in blood pressure control among U.S. adults with hypertension from 1999-2000 to 2007-2008, there was a stagnation and subsequent decrease post-2013 (Muntner P, et al., 2020).

## Introduction

**Motivation** 

- This study is motivated by the need to investigate the reasons behind this decline and to identify factors contributing to the diminishing control of hypertension in recent years.

**Study Objective**

- Examining the trends, awareness, and medication use in stage 2 hypertension among U.S. adults. 

- Assessing the impact of demographic factors and comorbid conditions on hypertension control.

## Methodology

1. Weighting and multiple year adjustment

2. Multiple Imputation to address missing data

3. Logistic Regression Models (Dobson, 2008):

Suppose there are $n$ covariates $X_i, i=1,\ ...\ n$, the model can be expressed as:

$$
log(\frac{\pi}{1-\pi})=X\beta = \beta_0+\beta_1X_1+...+\beta_nX_n
$$

- $\pi$ is the risk

- $\frac{\pi}{1-\pi}$ is the odds

- $\beta_0$ is the log odds for $X_i's=0$

- $\beta_i$ is the log odds ratio per unit change of $X_i$, holding all other covariates fixed
