## DataFest Project Summary
### Problem statement
Controlling blood pressure (BP) reduces the risk for cardiovascular disease. However, the prevalence of BP control (i.e., systolic BP < 140 and diastolic BP < 90) among US adults with hypertension has decreased since 2013. We invite teams to analyze publicly available data from US adults to help identify potential causes or correlates of worsening BP control among US adults with hypertension over the past decade, as this may allow for development of effective interventions to help control BP and prevent cardiovascular disease.

### Description 
Data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) containing information about demographics, blood pressure levels, hypertension status, antihypertensive medication usage, and co-morbidities for a sample of 59,799 noninstitutionalized US adults collected between 1999 and 2020.

### Availability 
The data can be downloaded from GitHub or accessed via the cardioStatsUSA R package. For both the file and information about the R package, see https://github.com/jhs-hwg/cardioStatsUSA.

### Accessing additional NHANES data
We highly recommend downloading additional NHANES data from https://wwwn.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/, and merging it with the data linked above, but this is not a requirement.

### Documentation
For a detailed description of all variables in the data, see https://jhs-hwg.github.io/cardioStatsUSA/reference/nhanes_data.html.

### Interactive exploration
A shiny application has been created to help explore hypertension statistics for US adults using these data. The application is available here: https://bcjaeger.shinyapps.io/nhanesShinyBP/

For more details on the data and the shiny application, see the supporting paper https://doi.org/10.1161/hypertensionaha.123.20900.
